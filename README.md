# hello_go

## Starting Out

Here we are, taking my first steps into the world of GO. Here is how you get started:
1) Create the repo here in github
2) Make sure the following path is created: %GOPATH%\src\github.com\jeking-illinois\
3) Navigate to the folder above
4) Clone the repo locally
```git clone https://github.com/jeking-illinois/hello_go```
5) Navigate to the now cloned repo
6) Initialize the GO module
```go mod init github.com/jeking-illinois/hello_go```
